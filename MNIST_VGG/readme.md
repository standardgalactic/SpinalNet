This folder contains scripts for training different NNs on different MNIST datasets.
As it is training from the scratch, it takes a long simulation time to receive 99.7+ accuracies. However, Networks with Spinal Fully connected layers brings a slightly higher accuracy compared to the traditional counterpart in most situations.

There is a demonstration of transfer learning on MNIST at the Jupyter Notebooks folder. 

https://github.com/dipuk0506/SpinalNet/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/transfer-learning-on-mnist-with-vgg.ipynb

In that notebook, test Accuracy, corresponding to the best validation accuracy = 99.75%.
