This folder contains scripts for training different NNs on different MNIST datasets.
As it is training from the scratch, accuracies are not that high. However, Networks with Spinal Fully connected layers brings a slightly higher accuracy compared to the traditional counterpart.
There is a demonstration of receiving high accuracy through transfer learning at the Jupyter Notebooks folder. 

https://github.com/dipuk0506/SpinalNet/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/transfer-learning-on-mnist-with-vgg.ipynb

In that notebook, test Accuracy, corresponding to the best validation accuracy = 99.75%.
